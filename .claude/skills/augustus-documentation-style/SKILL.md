# Documentation Style Guide

## Tone
- Clear
- Calm
- Professional
- No hype
- No marketing fluff

Assume the reader is technical but busy.

## README Structure
The README should follow this structure:

1. What is Augustus
2. Why it exists
3. What it can and cannot do
4. Installation
5. Basic usage example
6. Limitations

Keep it short. Precision over completeness.

## Writing Rules
- Short paragraphs
- Concrete examples
- Prefer showing over explaining
- Avoid buzzwords

## Examples
- CLI examples must be copy-pasteable
- Output examples must be realistic
- Never show fictional features

## Docs Folder
- Each document should answer one question
- Prefer 1-page docs
- No duplicated information across files

The documentation should make the project feel trustworthy and understandable in under 5 minutes.
